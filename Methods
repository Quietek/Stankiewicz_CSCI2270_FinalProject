---Method Explained---

void createTiles();
  This creates a graph system of the 81 tiles. No paramters required.

void createMines(std::string firstGuess);
  This creates 10 random mines on the map of 81 tiles. It takes in a string paaremter for your first guess to make sure
  a mine isn't created on the first tile you guess leading to an auto loss.
  
void createTileEdges();
  This creates the required vertices between the tiles created in the create tiles functio.
  
void assignMines();
  This code actually assigns the 10 mines which were created in createMines and put into a list.
  
void displayBoard();
  Displays the game board with tiles hit, adjacent mines, and tiles still not guessed, as well as empty space.
  
void firstCheck(std::string guess);
  This checks your guess with the special condition of it being your first. So you can;t lose. The string parameter
  is the location of the guess.
  
bool guessCheck(std::string guess);
  Same as above except true or false depending if you hit a mine or not. If you did it returns true, if not false
  and the game keeps going.
  
int minesByTile(tile* mineCheck);
  Takes the address of the tile. Checks it's adjacent members to see if they're mines. 
  Updates it's mines by value accordingly.
  
bool gameWon();
  Checks to see if you won the game, by checking if every tile which is not a mine has been visited.
